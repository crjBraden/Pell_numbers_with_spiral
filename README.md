This program prints the first several numbers in the Pell sequence and draws a spiral using those values.
The nth Pell number is given by this formula:

This program uses recursion in order to generate the Pell numbers starting from 1, not 0, since the main point of this program is to draw a spiral using the python turtle module,
and therefore a value of 0 is not useful.
